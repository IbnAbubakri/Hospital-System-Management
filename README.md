## Features Overview

### 1. Auxiliary Nurse Triage System

Located at `/triage`

Nurses can:
- **Receive patient complaints** - Enter symptoms and chief complaints
- **Auto-detect department** - System suggests appropriate department based on complaint
- **Assess severity** - Routine, Urgent, or Critical
- **View doctor availability** - See which doctors are available on selected date
- **Assign to doctor** - Select available doctor and time slot
- **Schedule appointment** - Create appointment that doctor will see

**Workflow:**
```
Patient arrives → Nurse enters complaint → System detects department
→ Nurse selects date → See available doctors → Select doctor & time
→ Appointment created → Doctor receives notification
```

### 2. Doctor Availability System

Each doctor has:
- **Working days** - Specific days they see patients
- **Time slots** - Available appointment times
- **Daily capacity** - Maximum appointments per day

**Example Schedule:**
- Dr. Emeka Adeleke (Cardiology): Monday, Wednesday, Friday | 6 slots/day
- Dr. Ibrahim Musa (General Medicine): Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri | 8 slots/day
- Dr. Aisha Yusuf (Pediatrics): Mon-Fri | 8 slots/day

### 3. Notification System

Doctors receive:
- **Notification bell** in header with badge count
- **Upcoming appointments list** in dropdown
- **Auto-refresh** on login
- **Quick access** to appointment details

### 4. Department Color Coding

| Department | Primary Color | Gradient |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Cardiology | Red | `#EF4444` → `#DC2626` |
| General Medicine | Blue | `#3B82F6` → `#2563EB` |
| Orthopedics | Orange | `#F59E0B` → `#D97706` |
| Pediatrics | Purple | `#A855F7` → `#9333EA` |
| Neurology | Green | `#10B981` → `#059669` |
| Administration | Indigo | `#6366F1` → `#4F46E5` |
| Auxiliary Nurse | Pink | `#EC4899` → `#DB2777` |
